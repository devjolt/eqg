def IP addressing
start
IPv4 is older than IPv6
IPv4 is an OSI layer 3 address
IPv6 is an OSI layer 3 address
IPv4 addresses are made of 4 bytes
IPv4 addresses are made of 4 octets
IPv4 addresses are made of 32 bits
Each of the 4 numbers in an IPv4 address is between 0 and 255#
IPv6 addresses are made of 16 bytes
IPv6 addresses are made of 128 bits
leading zeros in IPv6 addresses can be dropped
the first 64 bits in an IPv6 address is the network prefix
the last 64 bits in an IPv6 address is the host network address
every device needs a unique IP address
stop

def networking with IPv4
start
every device needs a unique IP address
a subnet mask is used by the local device to determine what subnet it is on
subnet mask is not usually transmitted accross the netowrk
default gateway is the IP address of a router on your subnet
a router allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet
an IP address starting 255... is likely to be a subnet mask
an IP address starting with 196... is likely to be a default gateway
stop

def DNS servers
start
routers understand IP addresses
routers do not understand url names
DNS stands for domain name services
DNS translates between url names and IP addresses
two DNS servers will often be configured
8.8.8.8 is a google DNS server
8.8.4.4 is a google DNS server
stop

def DHCP
start
BOOTP is the bootstrap protocol
BOOTP automatically handles much IPv4 configuration
BOOTP requires some manual configuration
BOOTP was superceded by DHCP
DHCP stands for dynamic host configuration protocol
BOOTP was released in 1993
DHCP was released in 1997
DHCP provides automatic address/IP configuration
DHCP works for almost all devices
stop

def DHCP steps
start
new clients broadcast to udp/67
local subnet DHCP server redundancy can be achieved with an external DHCP server
use of external DHCP server requires a router with DHCP relap enabled
DHCP relay and IP helper are the same thing
IP helper allows the use of an external DHCP server
DHCP servers recieving a udp/67 request will offer the first available IP address from a large pool
DHCP servers offer IP addresses on udp/68
client devices usually choose the first offer they recieve from multiple DHCP servers
client devices broadcast through udp/67 to request an available IP
DHCP servers acknowledge a client's request through udp/68
stop

def dynamic and static IP
start
DHCP servers recieving a udp/67 request will offer the first available IP address from a large pool
IP address will occasionally change by default
DHCP can be disabled on a device
IP address can be configured manually
an IP reservation associates a MAC address with an IP address
IP reservations happen on the DHCP server
IP reservation makes an IP address static
stop


def APIPA 
start
APIPA stands for automatic private IP addressing 
a link local address allows you to communicate locally with a DHCP server
link local addresses are not forwarded by routers
169.254.0.1 to 169.254.254.255 are reserved for link local addresses
link local address are assigned automatically
ARP confirms that an address isn't currently in use
ARP stands for address resolution protocol
stop

def IPvSix link local addresses
start
IPv6 local link addresses are non routable
IPv6 addresses only work on the local subnet
IPv6 local link addresses are always assigned
IPv6 local link addresses atart with fe80
the last 64 bits of a IPv6 local link address often correlates with MAC address
stop 

def SSL virtual private network
start
uses SSL/TLS protocol
works on tcp/443
avoids running into most firewall issues
authenticate users without digital certificates
authenticate users without shared passwords
can run inside a browser or client
also called client to side VPNs
also called remote access VPNs
requires software on user device
stop

def LAN and VLAN 
start
LAN stands for local area network
a LAN is a group of devices in the same broadcast domain seperated physically
VLAN stands for virtual local area network
a VLAN is a group of devices in the same broadcast domain seperated logically
stop

def network address translation
start
NAT stands for network address translation
NAT translates internal IP to external
all devices on a subnet have the same external address
NAT can happen through a router
