which of the following protocols would you use to
which of the following descriptions is associated with PROTOCOL

which port would you expect to use for NAME OF PROTOCOL
NAME OF PROTOCOL IS usually associated with which port

Engineer is trying to ACTIVITY. Which port should they make sure is open in the firewall?

Which of the following are valid source and destination ports to NAMED ACTIVITY:

which f the following are valid source and destination ports when using PROTOCOL

which of these are valid source and destination ports to be used between a client and server:

correct = 
source > 1023
correct protocol udp tcp
correct protocol port

HTTP data from TCP source port 3000 to TCP destination port 80
VoiP data from UDP source port 7100 to UDP destination port 5004
Email data from TCP source port 



two different ways to move data:
OSI layer 4 transport layer

multiplexing use many different application at the same time

tcp
connection oriented

reliable delivery recovery from errors
can manage ouit of oder messages or retransmissions
flow control the reciever can manage how much data is sent
tcp data tcp ack




OSI layers
7 application
high level apis, including resource sharing and remote file access
6 presentation
translation of data between a networking service and an application, including character encoding, data compression and encryp[tion\decryption]
5 session
managing continuous exhange of informaiton in the form of multiple back and forth transmissions between two nodes
4 transport
-segment or datagram
reliable transmission of data segments between points, inculding segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing
3 network 
-packet
- addressing, routing and traffic control of packets in a multi node network
2 data link layer 
-frame
- reliable transmission of data frames between two nides connected by a physical layer
1 physical 
-bit or symbol
- raw bit streams over physical medium


multiplexing use many different applications at the same time tcp, udp
