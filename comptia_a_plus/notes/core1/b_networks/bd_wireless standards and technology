def wireless frequencies
start
2.4GHz is a commonly used frequency
5Ghz is a commonly used frequency
some devices use both 2.4GHz and 5Ghz
5Ghz signals have a shorter range
2.4GHz signals have a longer range
802.11a devices can operate on 5Ghz
802.11ac devices can operate on 5Ghz
802.11n devices can operate on 5Ghz
802.11b devices can operate on 2.4Ghz
802.11g devices can operate on 2.4Ghz
802.11n devices can operate on 2.4Ghz
802.11n devices can operate on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz
there are three 20MHz channels available in the 2.4Ghz range
stop

def wireless channels and bandwidth
start
chanels are defined by the IEEE

RFID is powered by radio energy
RFID uses radio wave energy to tranmit an ID
bidirectional communication
some tag formats are actively powered
many tag formats are passively powered
stop

def near field communication
two way wireless communication
RFID is mostly one way communication
used in payment systems
used in online wallets
NFC can help with Bluetooth pairing
used in access tokens

def Zigbee
start
IEEE 802.13.4 standard
