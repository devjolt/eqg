a user in your company will shortly be making a busniess flight, during which they will be required to turn off all of their wireless networks during takeoff. 
after this, they want to be able to take advantage of the plane's free on board wifi. 

which of the following might they need to do in this situation?
correct:
airplane mode
iOS:swipe down to access the control center and turn on wifi
android: go to settings, and wireless and network settings to turn on wifi

incorrect:
plug the phone into the plane's ethernet
get the plane's bluetooth pin
find out the plane's bluetooth ID
iOS:swipe down to access the control center and turn on NFC
android: go to settings, then wireless and network settings to enable PAN

bluetooth pairing devices:
correct:
both devices must be bluetooth enabled
both devices must have bluetooth switched on
both devices must be on discoverable mode
a pin must be entered on the device making the connection request
all bluetooth deviced must be paired manually the first time they are paired
bluetooth devices may pair automatically after the first pairing
all discoverable devices in within range are listed

incorrect:
one of the devices must be bluetooth enabled
pairing always happens automatically
all devices with bluetooth on are discoverable
one of the devices must have bluetooth switched on


bluetooth requires pairing initially, but then disconnect and connect automatically
1. Both devices must have their bluetooth switched on
2. The device you wish to connect to must be discoverable
3. Find the device you wish to connect with in the discoverable devices list
4. Make a connection request
5. Enter the pin on the device you are connecting with
