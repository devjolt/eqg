def balanced pair
start
involves two wires
wires have equal and opposite signals
one wire carries a positive signal, the other a negative signal
can be used to transmit or recieve
wires are twisted
mutiple twisted pairs can be used in the same cable
pairs in the same cable have different twist rates
twisted pairs mean that at least one wire is constantly moving away from interference
stop

def cabling standards
items = (
    ('EIA', 'Electronic industries alliance'),
    ('TIA', 'Telecommunications Industry Association'),
    ('ISO', 'International Standards Organization'),
    ('IEC', 'International Electrotechnical Commission'),
)

def ISO IEC 11801 cabling standards
start
('Cat3', '10BASE-T', '100 m'),
('Cat5', '100BASE-TX', '1000BASE-T, 100m
('Cat5e', '100BASE-TX', '1000BASE-T, 100m enhance
('Cat6', '10GBASE-T', '37-55m
('Cat6a', '10GBASE-T', '100m augmented


No plenum - seperate air supply and air return
active or circulating plenum - shared with cabling and things
make sure netowrk cabling is suitable

Polyvinyl chloride is traditional cable jacket
fluroinated ethelene polymer FEP or low smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is fire rated cable jacket

plenum rated cable may not be as flexible - lower bend radius. 

Plan for worst case scenario


Unshielded vs shielded
UTP - most common, unshielded
STP - Additional shielding against interference, shield each pair and/or overall cable, requires cable to be grounded. 

u unshielded
S = braided shielding
f = foild shieldiong

overall cable / individual pairs
Braided entire + foil pairs  = S/FTP
foil entire and  no shielding for pairs = f/UTP


T568A and B
EIA/TIA 568 B standards
8 conductor 100 ohm balansted twisted pair cabling

T568A and B are different pin assignments for 8p8C connectors

T568A is horisontal
most just use B
both sides must be terminated with the same standards
